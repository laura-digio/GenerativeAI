# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework designed to manage and optimize the interaction between users and Large Language Models (LLMs). It ensures that the context provided to the model is relevant, concise, and structured to maximize the quality of the generated responses.

## Key components

### 1. Context Definition

The first step in **MCP** is defining the context required for the task. This involves identifying the relevant information, constraints, and objectives that the model needs to consider when generating responses.

### 2. Context Retrieval

Once the context is defined, the necessary information is retrieved from various sources. This can include databases, documents, APIs, or user inputs. The retrieval process ensures that only the most relevant data is included in the context.

### 3. Context Structuring

The retrieved information is structured into a format that the model can process effectively. This may involve organizing the data into sections, summarizing lengthy content, or converting it into a specific schema.

### 4. Context Injection

The structured context is then injected into the model's input prompt. This step ensures that the model has all the necessary information to generate accurate and relevant responses.

### 5. Feedback Loop

MCP includes a feedback mechanism to refine the context based on the model's output and user feedback. This iterative process helps improve the quality of the interaction over time.

## Tools

### LangChain

[LangChain](https://langchain.com) can be used to implement MCP by providing tools for context retrieval, structuring, and injection. It supports integration with various data sources and allows for the creation of dynamic prompts tailored to specific tasks.

### GenKit

[GenKit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) is a versatile toolkit that complements MCP by streamlining tasks such as data preprocessing, context structuring, and optimization. It can be used to enhance the quality of the context provided to the model, ensuring more accurate and relevant responses.
