# RAG Pipeline

> scraping → chunking → embeddings → vector database → chat interface

## 1. Scraping

The first step is to gather raw data, or **corpus**, from various sources. This can include websites, documents, or other repositories of information.

## 2. Chunking

Once the data is collected, it needs to be cleaned and split into manageable chunks. These chunks should be of appropriate size (e.g., 300–500 words or tokens) to ensure efficient processing.

### [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](MCP.md)

Using **MCP** principles, the **chunking** process can be enhanced by structuring the data to ensure relevance and alignment with the task objectives. This helps create more effective and concise chunks for downstream processing.

## 3. Embeddings

Each chunk is converted into a vector representation (embedding) using a pre-trained model. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.

## 4. Vector Database

The embeddings are stored in a vector database, which allows for fast and efficient retrieval of relevant chunks based on similarity searches.

## 5. Chat Interface

A user query is converted into an embedding, and the most relevant chunks are retrieved from the vector database. These chunks, along with the query, are passed to a language model to generate a response. This enables an interactive chat experience.

## Tools

### LangChain

[LangChain](https://langchain.com) simplifies the creation of RAG pipelines by providing tools for scraping, chunking, embedding generation, and integration with vector databases. It supports various data formats and allows for rapid development of applications like chat interfaces.

### GenKit

[GenKit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) is a versatile toolkit designed to streamline the development of Generative AI workflows. It can be used alongside LangChain to enhance processes like data preprocessing, embedding generation, and context optimization, making it easier to implement RAG Pipelines and MCP principles efficiently.
